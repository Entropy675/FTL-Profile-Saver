# FTL-Profile-Saver
A save program for the Faster Than Light video game.

I made this because I wanted it. 

It's pretty straight forward to use, just place ftlps.py in the /Documents/My Games/FasterThanLight folder where
the ae_prof.sav and the continue.sav files are located, and run "ftlps help", if you have python installed and
configured then it should run. 

Quick list of commands:
> ftlps help
* Shows the manual

> ftlps run
* Runs the game

> ftlps save {name}
* makes a save with the given name

> ftlps load {name}
* loads the given save name, if it doesn't exist does "ftlps list"

> ftlps list
* lists the saves locally stored in the saves folder
